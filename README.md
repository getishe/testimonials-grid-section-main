## My process

I started by analyzing the design and breaking it down into components. I created a simple React app using Next.js and styled it with Styled Components. The layout was built using CSS Grid for the testimonials section, ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes. I also utilized Flexbox for aligning elements within the testimonials.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my skills in responsive design and CSS Grid. I also want to explore more advanced features of Styled Components, such as theming and global styles. Additionally, I aim to enhance my understanding of accessibility best practices to ensure that my projects are inclusive for all users.
